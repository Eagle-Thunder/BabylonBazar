# BabylonBazar
An online market - from shoppers, by the shoppers

# The WHY
This here project is our final team project in CodeCool. Our previous team project was on the same lines and we wanted to do "a propper job".

# The WHAT
This project is in development. It is intended as a fully opertional online market where anyone can sell and buy anything (hence the name bazar). 

# The HOW
ASP.NET is used for the backend, while React is used for frontend. Data is sored dinamically in an Entity maintain MSSQL database.
Following is the final intended funtionality (unless we think of something else to add). A visitor may see and search available products, but anything else
requires registration. A registered user can act as a buyer or a seller.
As a seller, he registers products he desires to sell, which will be reviewed by an admin and posted on the site. When buyers waht theyr products, they
receive a notification saying what they need to deliver and where. After delivery the payment is deivered into their account as credits. Those credits can
be used to make purchaises of their own or converted to hard cash using the creditcard of choice.
As a buyer, a user can add products to his own shoppingcart, modify that shopping cart, then place an order with its contents. This will notify all the
sellers of all products in that cart they are expected to deliver. The value of the items is deducted from the buyer credits, but if the delivery does not happen
they may request a refund. The buyer must select his delivery address of choice in order to process the cart. Also, at any time, he can load or unload credits to
his account using the creditcard of choice. This service is provided by a third party. A buyer can also leave comments and rate products.

# The WHO
This project is being worked on by a team of two - myself and Sergiu Pert.
